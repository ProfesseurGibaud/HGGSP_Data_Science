#Limesurvey analysis : An Analysis of History and geographic french high school teacher

The goal of this project is to extract, clean, read and data-analyse data from a limesurvey survey.
We use the limesurvey extraction to a csv file. Column have different senses (either numeric value, boolean value or text). Several boolean column may answer to the same question. Also some people gave obviously false results (as an age of 150)
In order to apply a Lasso regression algorithm we had to choose and implement a pertinent metric for each interesting explicative variable.
